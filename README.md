## Project Structure

### HTML (index.html)

The project's HTML file (`index.html`) is well-organized and follows best practices. It includes the necessary meta tags for the character set and viewport, links to essential favicon images, and external CSS and JavaScript libraries. Key sections of the website are divided into various divs, including the navigation bar, hero section, features section, search and filter section, testimonials section, and the footer.

### CSS (styles.css)

The project's styles are defined in the `styles.css` file. It utilizes a combination of custom styles and external libraries such as Font Awesome, Remixicon, and Locomotive Scroll for a visually appealing and responsive design. The styles are modularized, making it easy to understand and modify specific components.

### JavaScript (script.js)

The JavaScript functionality is implemented in the `script.js` file. It utilizes the GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP) and Locomotive Scroll for smooth scroll animations and page transitions. Additionally, there are event listeners for mouse movements, notifications, and search functionality.
